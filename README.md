# IntelliCook Mobile

The mobile frontend app for IntelliCook.

## Development Setup

This app uses [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Since I am using Android Studio, I will be able to provide more instructions for setting up the project in Android Studio.

1. Clone the repository.

2. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Run the [install_hooks.sh](./install_hooks.sh) shell script to install a pre-commit hook which can help check if your code will pass the GitHub workflows before you commit.
